### Hi there üëã

# How I like to work

**From home** üòÅ

**Asynchronously**: Colleagues should send me messages at their convenience and I will respond as soon as I can.

**Public channel messages are preferred** over Direct Messages simply because discussions in public channels is searchable. DMs should only contain information that is private.

Directly with others. I prefer **pair programming** where we take turns driving. Swarming on issues is also effective with 3-4 people.

I am not interested in taking all the credit for wins. I am also not interested in placing blame when we miss the target, but from **learning as much as we can from our mistakes.**

The best way to communicate with me is **visually**. I am a visual learner and I tend to miss important details unless accompanied with words, graphs, charts, and visualizations. Repetition and emphasis are appreciated as I grasp new concepts.

I value **simple, straightforward communication**. I appreciate it when people present the bottom line as immediately as possible. I also really like metaphors and analogies. I'm turned off when people use big words or acronyms and assume everyone knows what they mean.

**GitHub PRs should be focused and have a lot of discussion**. Descriptions should be clear and reasons for the changes should be well documented. This artifact should stand the test of time so that when we are all gone there is a clear record.

I appreciate **adversarial thinking** from my coworkers and colleagues. Having a growth mentality means testing ideas constantly and feel around them for vulnerabilities. I do not get offended when my ideas are attacked. I'm turned off when people have all of their pride wrapped up in their ideas and refuse to accept criticism.

I really appreciate **initiative** when others reach out to me to help.

**Frequent breaks.** Usually after 1.5 hours, I will get to a point where progress is made but at diminishing returns. It is super helpful to take a break where I remove myself from the context of the problem and refresh my mind. The greatest breakthroughs come after taking breaks.

I am most productive in **small, well defined meetings** that have an agenda.
