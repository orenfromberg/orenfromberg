### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# How I like to work

I like to work directly with others on hard problems and achieve success as a team. I am not interested in taking credit for wins. I am also not interested in placing blame when we miss the target, but from learning as much as we can from our mistakes.

The best way to communicate with me is visually. I am a visual learner and I tend to miss important details unless accompanied with words, graphs, charts, and visualizations. Repetition and emphasis are appreciated as I grasp new concepts.

I value simple, straightforward communication. I appreciate it when people present the bottom line as immediately as possible. I also really like metaphors and analogies. I'm turned off when people use big words or acronyms and assume everyone knows what they mean.

GitHub PRs are a valuable place to put effort. Descriptions should be clear and reasons for the changes should be well documented. This artifact should stand the test of time so that when we are all gone there is a clear record.

I appreciate adversarial thinking from my coworkers and colleagues. Having a growth mentality means testing ideas constantly and feel around them for vulnerabilities. I do not get offended when my ideas are attacked. I'm turned off when people have all of their pride wrapped up in their ideas and refuse to accept criticism.

That said, I have had a hard time in the past asking for help. I really appreciate when others reach out to me to help.

I like to take breaks. Usually after 1.5 hours, I will get to a point where progress is made but at diminishing returns. It is super helpful to take a break where I remove myself from the context of the problem and refresh my mind. The greatest breakthroughs come after taking breaks.

I am most productive in meetings that are small and well defined with an agenda.
